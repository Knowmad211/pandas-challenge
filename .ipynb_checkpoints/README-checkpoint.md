Module #4 Homework Challenge

All data in the exercise was drawn from the starter code we were provided, as well as the two .csv files we were provided (schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv).

All code was written using class notes, class demonstrations, and class exercises all found on the class repository. 

Work on the code was done with other classmates (most notably Paolo Arciaga), as well as help from AskBCS Learning assistants, and my Tutor, Asiha Braxton-Garvin.
