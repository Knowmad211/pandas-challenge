Written Analysis of the PyCitySchools Assignment

Data Summary
- Spending had a negative correlation with average student performance: eg. the more money that was spent on students per capita, the lower their scores were in both math and reading.
- Charter schools outperformed District schools significantly in terms of passing rates (this can potentially be explained by District schools being generally larger than Charter schools)

Conclusion #1
- Charter schools are significantly more likely to have a student pass both math and reading (separately and together), even though some Charter schools had a lower spend per student than similar district schools.

Conclusion #2
- Even though Smaller and Middle sized schools performed similarly in terms of passing rates for both math and reading, once the school sizes increase past 2000 students, passing rates dropped significantly in both math and reading scores.
